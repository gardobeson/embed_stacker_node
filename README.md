# Comfy UI embed_stacker_node
This is a multi-embedding picker/stacker which is mostly copied from "tropfchen" 's embedding picker node. 

Instead of prepending a bunch of nodes together to get a stack, just use them all in the same node.

The weight slider adjusts all 4 nodes, together.

## Description
